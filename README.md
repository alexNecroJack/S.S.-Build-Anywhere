# S.S.-Build-Anywhere
A mod for Starsector V. 0.9a(currently: RC10) that allows the player to build
makeshift array, makeshift sensor array and makeshift communication relay anywhere.
Really, ANYWHERE! :D
No need for stable locations any more!

You do this by activating the user ability.
The mod ensures the player has this ability on every game load (just for safety reasons :D).

I can't see a reason why anyone would have a problem adding or removing this mod midplay (== With saved game).
The only this is:
Removing the mod midplay, would mean that any makeshift object built anywhere,
when salvaged without the presence of this mod, will instantly create a "Stable location" in  it's place xD...
(While if deconstructed WITH the mod, no stable location is created)

Happy buildiiiing :D

Hint: If you construct something while in orbit (of ANYTHING), then the built object is moving, IN, ORBIIIIIIIT ^_^ :D YEYYYYYYY



Libraries used for compiling:
- Slick2D (jnlp.jar, jogg-0.0.7.jar, jorbis-0.0.15.jar, lwjgl.jar, lwjgl_util.jar, slick.jar)
- StarfarerAPI (starfarer.api.jar, starfarer.api.zip)
Not all of those are needed, I'm just recording them as hints.

(The images are not checked for copyrights... emmm... shhhh.. xD. It's in the "TODO List" to find a right image.)



Structure:
Folder "src" has the source for the mod.
Folder "Graphics" has uneditted/raw graphics.
Folder "Build Anywhere" is the mod folder as it is to be dropped in the game folder "mods".
