# S.S.-Build-Anywhere
A mod for Starsector V. 0.9a(currently: RC10) that allows the player to build<br/>
makeshift array, makeshift sensor array and makeshift communication relay anywhere.<br/>
Really, ANYWHERE! :D<br/>
No need for stable locations any more!<br/>
<br/>
You do this by activating the user ability.<br/>
The mod ensures the player has this ability on every game load (just for safety reasons :D).<br/>
<br/>
I can't see a reason why anyone would have a problem adding or removing this mod midplay (== With saved game).<br/>
The only this is:<br/>
Removing the mod midplay, would mean that any makeshift object built anywhere,<br/>
when salvaged without the presence of this mod, will instantly create a "Stable location" in  it's place xD...<br/>
(While if deconstructed WITH the mod, no stable location is created)<br/>
<br/>
Happy buildiiiing :D<br/>
<br/>
Hint: If you construct something while in orbit (of ANYTHING), then the built object is moving, IN, ORBIIIIIIIT ^_^ :D YEYYYYYYY<br/>

Everything else was found out by reading the Javadocs of methods/classes/etc through the Netbeans, and searching in Nexerelin ;D<br/>
