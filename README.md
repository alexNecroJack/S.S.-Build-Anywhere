# S.S.-Build-Anywhere
A mod for Starsector V. 0.9a(currently: RC10) that allows the player to build
makeshift array, makeshift sensor array and makeshift communication relay anywhere.
Really, ANYWHERE! :D
No need for stable locations any more!

You do this by activating the user ability.
The mod ensures the player has this ability on every game load (just for safety reasons :D).

I can't see a reason why anyone would have a problem adding or removing this mod midplay (== With saved game).
The only this is:
Removing the mod midplay, would mean that any makeshift object built anywhere,
when salvaged without the presence of this mod, will instantly create a "Stable location" in  it's place xD...
(While if deconstructed WITH the mod, no stable location is created)

Happy buildiiiing :D

Hint: If you construct something while in orbit (of ANYTHING), then the built object is moving, IN, ORBIIIIIIIT ^_^ :D YEYYYYYYY
